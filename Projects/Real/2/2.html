            PURPOSE: To act as a piano for a singer’s sheet music
            <br><br>
            HOW TO: Click a note on one of the staffs, and the corresponding note plays as a piano sound back to you.
            <br><br>
            DESCRIPTION: I made this because, as a singer, trying to figure out the note on a music sheet could be a pain. Using a piano meant that I had to know which notes on the piano corresponded to the sheet of music. This simplifies that process considerably. I showed this to my choir teacher, who said she wanted to use it with her classes. The website has several inside jokes for that reason.
