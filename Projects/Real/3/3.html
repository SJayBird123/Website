            PURPOSE: To act as a mobile-friendly chess timer for the tournaments I was running
            <br><br>
            HOW TO: Click either side of the chess timer, and the opposing side's time will start. After making a move, players press their side of the clock to continue their opponent's timer. The Reset button resets the timer. The Cut buttons cut 5 minutes from the time of either player. 
            <br><br>
            DESCRIPTION: Many people did not have a timer app installed at the chess tournaments I was running between Concord High School and Brandywine High School. There weren't any convenient online alternatives, so I made this. 
            <br><br>
            TOOLS: HTML, CSS, Javascript
