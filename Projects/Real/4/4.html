            PURPOSE: To empower a child with disabilities while providing a unique opportunity to have fun. 
            <br><br>
            DESCRIPTION: I made this adapted Ride-On-Truck (I sometimes say Power Wheels for the generic trademark) with a partner for a child with heart and mobility issues. I handled most of the electronics and programming aspects of the project, and my partner worked on the physical modifications of the truck. We physically adapted the truck for the child's needs, made a remote control system for the teacher, and made a physical controller for the student. In the end, we were able to make a control system for the student, but we needed more time to test and guarantee its safety. Our final configuration used an Arduino as the main computer, a motor controller powered by a 12V battery wired to the Arduino, a Bluetooth module that could communicate with a phone app, and a controller made of buttons wired into the Arduino.
