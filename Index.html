<h2>These are the semi-completed games I have made that I am too ashamed to publish but not ashamed enough to hide 
in the depths of my heart.
</h2>

<h5>
In all seriousness I have problems with project completion so the vast majority of my games never see the light of day. 
Additionally there are things I have made that are just too bad to publish. This site was originally meant for projects 
I spend less than an hour or two on (so they intentionally are bad) but I think I will post more of my old projects that 
are somewhat playable.
